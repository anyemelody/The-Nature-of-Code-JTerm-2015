# The Nature of Code, NYUAD, JTerm 2015, London

Can we capture the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties of nature in software? Can understanding the mathematical principles behind our physical world world help us to create digital worlds? This class focuses on the programming strategies and techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems. We explore topics ranging from basic mathematics and physics concepts to more advanced simulations of complex systems. Subjects covered include forces, trigonometry, fractals, cellular automata, self-organization, and genetic algorithms. No computer programming experience is required, the course will start with the basics of code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with the [p5js](http://p5js.org/) framework). In addition to learning technical skills and discussing scientific concepts, students will have the opportunity to visit science museums, art galleries, and artist studios in the London area.

## Teaching Methodologies
* Class time will be divided between technical lectures, independent project development, individual meetings with instructor, and project presentations / critique.
* In addition to regular class meetings, the instructor will organize a series of field trips to visit artist studios, gallery shows, and museum exhibits in the London area.

* Define the fundamentals of computation.
* Build creative software sketches that demonstrate knowledge of these fundamentals.
* Critically examine interactive art in the context of screen, sculpture, and web.
* Apply concepts from physics and mathematics to real-time software animation.
* Develop methodologies for simulating nature using computational algorithms.
